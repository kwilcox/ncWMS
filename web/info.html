  <p><b>Welcome</b> to the <a href="http://www.resc.rdg.ac.uk">Reading e-Science Centre</a>'s GODIVA2 site.  This site
    demonstrates the visualization of ocean forecast and analysis data using
    Google Maps and Google Earth.  This site works best in Mozilla Firefox
    but also works in most modern browsers such as Internet Explorer 6.0 and Opera 8.5.</p>
    <p><b>How to use:</b> Select a dataset and variable (field) from the menu
    above. The data will be extracted and projected onto the Google Map (right).
    Navigate around the map by dragging it and using the zoom controls in the top
    left corner of the map. Change the date and time of the data being displayed
    by using the calendar control (top right).  Change the depth of the data
    being displayed by using the Depth drop-down box (if applicable).  Change
    the colour range by editing the boxes at the top and bottom of the colour 
    scale to the right of the map. (Firefox only: change the opacity of the 
    data overlay by using the control at the bottom right corner of the map.
    This allows you to see the bathymetry through the data.)</p>
    <p>At any time, click "Open in Google Earth" to view the data in <a href="http://earth.google.com">Google Earth</a>.
    You will need to install Google Earth first.</p>
