 * <p>A {@link LutGenerator} that uses an algorithm similar to that used by the
 * <a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/">Panoply</a> NetCDF and
 * HDF viewer.  This calculates the extents of grid cells in the {@link CurvilinearGrid}
 * by joining up adjacent grid <i>points</i>.  (Note that this differs from the
 * {@link ToolsUiLutGenerator}, in which cells are formed by joining grid <i>corners</i>.)</p>
 * <p>Many thanks to Robert Schmunk for kindly spending the time to
 * explain to me how Panoply works.</p>
 * <p>This class is stateless and therefore only a single {@link #INSTANCE instance}
